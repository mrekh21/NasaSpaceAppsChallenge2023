# SpaceAppsChallenge2023

This is a project for Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2023. These are solutions to address fire and natural
resource monitoring through innovative use of technology and publicly available data, enabling 
local communities to report and monitor fires and/or improve current data distribution. We 
developed hardware to effectively monitor wildfires. Our divice consisted of several sensors
which were used to measure infrared radiation level, carbon monoxide consentration, 
shifts in temperature and changes in humidity level. We created a system that based on these
4 parameters calculated the possible probability of wildfire and provided this information 
to the population and the monitoring group.

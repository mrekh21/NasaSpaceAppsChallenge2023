# SpaceAppsChallenge2023

This is project for Space Apps Challenge 2023. These are solutions to address fire and natural
resource monitoring through innovative use of technology and publicly available data, enabling 
local communities to report and monitor fires and/or improve current data distribution. We 
developed hardware to effectively monitor wildires.
